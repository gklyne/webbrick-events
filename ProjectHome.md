Simple real-time event distribution for web applications

This project contains a collection of libraries in Python and Javascript to support the real-time distribution of simple events via a distributed publish/subscribe mechanism.  The libraries have been developed to use Web protocols and software for control and monitoring of building systems (e.g. heating, lighting and other home automation functions).

The Javascript code includes a framework for widgets, based on TurboGears widgets, for generating and responding to real-time events in web browser pages and applications; e.g. for dynamic real-time control panels.

Some of the code uses TurboGears and MochiKit libraries.
The Widget MVC framework is derived from a code structure designed by Alistair Miles.
