#summary Summary of test regimes provided

= Introduction =

The code in the project consists of server- and client- Python code, and client Javascript code for browser access.

A number of test environments are provided:
 * Stand-alone python unit tests
 * Stand-alone Javascript unit tests, run in browser
 * Integrated Python client/Python server tests
 * Integrated Javascript client/Python server tests
 * Selenium user interface tests

= Stand-alone python unit tests =

The test framework recognizes command line options to select tests to run, verbosity and log output: use `--help` to see the options.

 * `MiscLib/tests/TestAll.py`
 * `EventLib/tests/TestAll.py`

= Stand-alone Javascript unit tests =

Tests consist of synchronous tests that must be run in the jsUnit test runner, and asynchronous tests that are loaded directly into a browser.  (This is for historical reasons:  initially, testing was done using jsUnit, but this can't handle tests with asynchronous completion, so I switched to using the variant of SimpleTest provide by the MochiKit libraries.)

 * `.../tests/static/testRunner.html` - jsUnit test runner: load into browser to run jsUnit tests.  Note that the test suites use relative paths, and must be run using the jsUnit test runner loaded from the same directory.

 * `MiscLib/tests/static/TestAll.html` - run in jsUnit test runner
 * `EventLib/tests/static/TestAll.html` - run in jsUnit test runner

 * `MiscLib/tests/static/TestAsyncAll.html` - run directly in browser
 * `EventLib/tests/static/TestAsyncAll.html` - run directly in browser
 * Widget component tests - run directly in browser:
   * `WidgetLib/tests/static/TestMvcUtils.html`
   * `WidgetLib/tests/static/TestSimpleButton.html`
   * `WidgetLib/tests/static/TestNumericDisplay.html`
   * (etc.)
