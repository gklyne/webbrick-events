Javascript event distribution libraries - TODO notes
====================================================

Javascript event forwarding library

* HTTP event forwarding re-write.

* EventPubSub/EventRouter:  think more clearly about what functionality is required.
  Try to tease the functions apart more cleanly, and determine which pieces should be dropped 
  for client-side handling, where routing is a binary choice.

* Reimplement WildDict.prototype.iterate using iterateKey
